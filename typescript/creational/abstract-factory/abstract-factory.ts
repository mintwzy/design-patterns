Class MazeFactory can create components of mazes. It builds rooms, walls, and doors between rooms. It might be used by
a program that reads plans for mazes from a file and builds the corresponding maze. Or it might be used by a program
that builds mazes randomly. Programs that build mazes take a MazeFactory as an argument so that the programmer can
specify the classes of rooms, walls, and doors to construct.

/*
Recall that the member function CreateMaze (page 84) builds a small maze consisting of two rooms with a door between
them. CreateMaze hard-codes the class names, making it difficult to create mazes with different components.

Hereâ€™s a version of CreateMaze that remedies that shortcoming by taking a MazeFactory as a parameter:
